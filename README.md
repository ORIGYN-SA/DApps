# ORIGYN dApps Monorepo

This repository is a monorepo containing standard ORIGYN dApps.

## üèÅ Quickstart

- Requires `node 16` in order to install all dependencies.
- The @origyn/origyn-art-ui library is published in the GitHub Package Registry, which requires that you first authenticate before installing the package.

```
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@origyn-sa --always-auth
npm install
npm run bootstrap
```

### Running

Each dApp can be started using webpack as a local development server by running the following script from the root of the monorepo:

```
npm run start:vault
```

### Building

The following script will build every dApp within the monorepo:

`$ npm run build:all`

The `dist` folder contains built html files for each dApp. A single package can be build by running its specific script, e.g: `npm run build:vault` to build the vault only.

## üöÄ Local Development

In order to connect the dApps to the local environment, you will need the following:

- [Origyn NFT Canister](https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/origyn_nft)
- [ICP Ledger Canister (for ICP transactions)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/ledger-local-setup/)
- OGY Ledger Canister (for OGY transactions)

The local development settings will be visible on the left menu if the web origin is localhost.
In order to make your dApp connect to local canisters, you will need to:

- Click `Local Development Settings` on the side bar
- Check `Use Local Network (http://localhost:8000)`
- (optional) Fill the canister id of the local ledger replica for each token you have in your dApp. You will need this to get balance and send transactions.

Example:

```
http://localhost:8080/-/sp3hj-caaaa-aaaaa-aaajq-cai/-/bm-1/-/vault
```

This will make [Connect2IC](https://github.com/Connect2IC/connect2ic) create an actor for the canister `sp3hj-caaaa-aaaaa-aaajq-cai`.
